# E-Voting based on Private Blockchain.
## Abstract
For years we have been using paper ballots and recently some countries started
using electronic voting machines, but both systems have their flaws. Running a
paper ballot election is costly, and votes counted on paper ballots are prone to
errors. To overcome issued faced by Electronic voting machines have come into
play, but Electronic voting machines are also easy to manipulate, and prone to hack.
To overcome these issues this research brings one of the most secure methods of
E-voting using blockchain technology. Being decentralized, immutable, consensus
blockchain can provide trust and transparent, anonymous voting. In this thesis we
are implementing a electronic voting system using permissioned/private blokchain.
